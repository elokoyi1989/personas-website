      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The objective of this project was to better understand user interactions with a real world interface system. I chose to look at digital ticket kiosks for public transportation. My goal was to observe how people use these
          kiosks, identify opportunities for improvement, and consider a more intuitive, efficient, and accesible interface. Through  observation, interviews, persona creation, and storyboarding, I learned about both user research and design development.</p>

    <section id="observations">
      <h2>Observations</h2>
      <p>During my observation sessions, I took note of different patterns and habits of users:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Users exhibited varied interactions: some meticulously navigated screens,
           while others quickly skipped through. This let me know that the interface is often used by regulars and city natives as well as tourists, new comers, and should appeal to a diverse set of needs</li>
        <li>The hesitancy to touch screens directly with user's fingers suggested  hygiene concerns, suggesting a need for integrated sanitizing solutions.</li>
        <li> also noticed that many people expected the payment system to have tap to pay and realized only when they got to the payment portion that it was cash or physical card only.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="interview">
      <h2>Interview Insights</h2>
      <p>I conducted a few intereviews on users of the kiosk to hear directly form users. Using these interviews, I was able to draw conclusions and develop insights on the kiosk experience:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>If you were asked to make the experience faster what would you change? </strong> A user had the idea to automate the process by using a streamlined ticket-buying process where the kiosk asks questions about the trip and the travelers and immediately receive the cheapest possible ticket options.
.</li>
        <li><strong>If this is your first time using this interface, did you do any prior research on how to use it?</strong> Most people said they did not do any prior research but relied on their prior experience of public transportation in other cities to guide them.</li>
        <li><strong>Why did you choose this interface over the person kiosk?</strong>  People preferred to use the digital ticket kiosk because it seemed easier and less stressful than interacting with a human. One person also cited the potential of embarrassment when interacting with a human or potentially encountering a language barrier.</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="personas">
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>To better understand the distinct user types, I constructed two personas:</p>
      <div class="persona">
        <img src="curtis.jpeg" alt="Empathy map for Malcolm">
        <p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Malcolm:</strong> A local resident who enjoys the convenience of bulk ticket purchases but occasionally forgets his pass. Malcolm appreciates efficient navigation.</p>
  
 </div>
            </section>

            <section id="personas2"> 
     
      <div class="persona">
        <img src="jennamap.jpeg" alt="Empathy map for Jenna">
        <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Jenna:</strong> A visiting tourist unfamiliar with local transportation who is traveling with her family. Jenna seeks reassurance from the kiosk experience, hoping to avoid confusion and extra costs.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
</section>   
    <section style="background-color:#934B00;" id="storyboard">
      <h2>Storyboard</h2>
      <p>I created a storyboard of Jenna's interaction scenario to deepen user insight.</p>
      <div class="frames">
        <img src="story1.jpeg" alt="Storyboard frame 1">
        <img src="story2.jpeg" alt="Storyboard frame 2">
    
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="reflection">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project effectively underscored the critical role user-centered research plays in designing public-facing digital systems. By actively observing and directly engaging with users, I identified real-world frustrations. The persona creation and storyboarding stages provided deep empathy and clear narrative insights, ensuring my solutions targeted actual user needs. Moving forward, this experience reinforces my commitment to iterative design processes, always grounded in genuine user insights.</p>
