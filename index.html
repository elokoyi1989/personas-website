      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The objective of this project was to better understand user interactions with a real world interface system. I chose to look at digital ticket kiosks for public transportation. My goal was to observe how people use these
          kiosks, identify opportunities for improvement, and consider a more intuitive, efficient, and accesible interface. Through  observation, interviews, persona creation, and storyboarding, I learned about both user research and design development..</p>

    <section id="observations">
      <h2>Observations</h2>
      <p>During field observation sessions, several noteworthy behaviors and patterns emerged:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Users exhibited varied interactions: some meticulously navigated screens, while others quickly skipped through, indicating diverse familiarity levels.</li>
        <li>The hesitancy to touch screens directly highlighted hygiene concerns, suggesting a need for integrated sanitizing solutions.</li>
        <li>Payment expectations often mismatched reality, revealing a strong preference for tap-to-pay functionality.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="interview">
      <h2>Interview Insights</h2>
      <p>Interviews provided critical user perspectives on improving the kiosk experience:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Speed and Efficiency:</strong> Users suggested streamlining ticket selection by automating responses based on trip details to quickly offer optimal ticket options.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation Level:</strong> Most users relied on existing public transit experiences rather than dedicated pre-research, highlighting the importance of intuitive design.</li>
        <li><strong>Interface Preference:</strong> Users overwhelmingly favored digital kiosks over human-operated ones, citing reduced stress, embarrassment, and language barrier concerns.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="personas">
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>To better understand the distinct user types, I created detailed personas:</p>
      <div class="persona">
        <img src="curtis.jpeg" alt="Empathy map for persona Malcolm">
        <p><strong>Malcolm:</strong> A local resident who enjoys the convenience of bulk ticket purchases but occasionally forgets his pass.
             Malcolm prefers digital interfaces to avoid unnecessary interactions and appreciates efficient navigation.</p>
 </div>

            <section id="personas2"> 
     
      <div class="persona">
        <img src="jennamap.jpeg" alt="Empathy map for persona Jenna">
        <p><strong>Jenna:</strong> A visiting tourist unfamiliar with local transportation who is traveling with her family. Jenna seeks reassurance from the kiosk experience, hoping to avoid confusion and extra costs.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
</section>   
    <section id="storyboard">
      <h2>Storyboard</h2>
      <!-- <p>The storyboard visually narrates an improved interaction scenario, emphasizing ease of use, clear guidance, and rapid transactions.</p> -->
      <div class="frames">

    </section>

    <section id="reflection">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project effectively underscored the critical role user-centered research plays in designing public-facing digital systems. By actively observing and directly engaging with users, I identified real-world frustrations and effectively addressed them in my redesign. The persona creation and storyboarding stages provided deep empathy and clear narrative insights, ensuring my solutions targeted actual user needs. Moving forward, this experience reinforces my commitment to iterative design processes, always grounded in genuine user insights.</p>
